## How do I use this service?

There is alot of confusion when it comes to searching a user but we will do our best to break it down into simple terms for you to understand.\
\
If you search for **Alwin** and you believe or curious if any of **Alwin's **private rooms are currently open. If the results are shown discovered you are in luck, this means one of Alwin's private room is active.\
\
In this screenshot above, we can see Alwin (Private Room Owner) has invited their friends JuneblueCrystal and GaleDevon.

We can also preview their outfits they wore in the private room along with pop-up profile as an optional.

<Note>
  If GaleDevon joins Alwin's private room and you scan GaleDevon, you won't find any results. Instead you need to search **Alwin** who is the private room owner not ~GaleDevon~.
</Note>

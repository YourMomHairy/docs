In this screenshot above, we can see Alwin (Private Room Owner) has invited their friends JuneblueCrystal and GaleDevon.

We can also preview their outfits they wore in the private room along with pop-up profile as an optional.

<Note>
  If GaleDevon joins Alwin's private room and you scan GaleDevon, you won't find any results. Instead you need to search **Alwin** who is the private room owner not ~~GaleDevon~~.
